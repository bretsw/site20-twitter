include_graphics("img/collection.jpg")
```

--

* I collected tweets with a `Twitter Archiving Google Sheet (TAGS)` (Hawksey, 2014)

--

  * all tweets containing the keyword text "#edchat"

--

  * October 1, 2017 to June 5, 2018 (8 months)

--

* I obtained tweet metadata using the `rtweet` R package (Kearney, 2018)

* Here, we've looked at the **hashtag-thread mashup**, comparing hashtag replies to upstream replies

--

  * Including multiple hashtags ~ bringing multiple spaces together

--

  * Adding a hashtag at the end of a thread of replies ~ building a bridge to a past conversation

--

  * Dropping a hashtag in a thread of replies ~ walking out of the room where a conversation may still be happening
